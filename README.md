## What is this? üßê

`nextjs-routes` makes Next.js's `next/link` and `next/router` routes type safe with zero runtime overhead. `nextjs-routes` scans your `pages` and/or `app` directory and generates route types based on your application's routes.

`nextjs-routes` drops into your existing Next.js application with minimal configuration. You won't have to change any code, unless it finds some broken links!

## Highlights

ü¶Ñ Zero config

üí® Types only -- zero runtime

üõ† No more broken links

ü™Ñ Route autocompletion

üîó Supports all Next.js route types: static, dynamic, catch all and optional catch all

## Installation & Usage üì¶

1. Add this package to your project:

   `npm install nextjs-routes` or `yarn add nextjs-routes`

2. Update your `next.config.js`:

   ```diff
   + const withRoutes = require("nextjs-routes/config")();

   /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
   const nextConfig = {
     reactStrictMode: true,
   };

   - module.exports = nextConfig;
   + module.exports = withRoutes(nextConfig);
   ```

3. Start or build your next project:

   `npx next dev` or `npx next build`

That's it! A `nextjs-routes.d.ts` file will be generated the first time you start your server. Check this file into version control. `next/link` and `next/router` type definitions have been augmented to verify your application's routes. No more broken links, and you get route autocompletion üôå.

In development, whenever your routes change, your `nextjs-routes.d.ts` file will automatically update.

If you would prefer to generate the route types file outside of `next dev` or `next build` you can also invoke the cli directly: `npx nextjs-routes`.

## Examples üõ†

### Link

`Link`'s `href` prop is now typed based on your application routes:

```tsx
import Link from "next/link";

<Link
  href={{
    pathname: "/foos/[foo]",
    query: { foo: "bar" },
  }}
>
  Bar
</Link>;
```

If the route doesn't require any parameters, you can also use a path string:

```tsx
<Link href="/foo">Foo</Link>
```

### useRouter

`useRouter`'s returned router instance types for `push`, `replace` and `query` are now typed based on your application routes.

Identical to `Link`, `push` and `replace` now expect a UrlObject or path string:

#### push

```tsx
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

const router = useRouter();
router.push({ pathname: "/foos/[foo]", query: { foo: "test" } });
```

#### replace

```tsx
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

const router = useRouter();
router.replace({ pathname: "/" });
```

#### query

```tsx
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

// query is typed as a union of all query parameters defined by your application's routes
const { query } = useRouter();
```

By default, `query` will be typed as the union of all possible query parameters defined by your application routes. If you'd like to narrow the type to fewer routes or a single page, you can supply a type argument:

```tsx
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

const router = useRouter<"/foos/[foo]">();
// query is now typed as `{ foo?: string | undefined }`
router.query;
```

You can further narrow the query type by checking the router's `isReady` property.

```tsx
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

const router = useRouter<"/foos/[foo]">();
// query is typed as `{ foo?: string | undefined }`
router.query;

if (router.isReady) {
  // query is typed as `{ foo: string }`
  router.query;
}
```

Checking `isReady` is necessary because of Next's [Automatic Static Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/automatic-static-optimization). The router's query object will be empty for pages that are Automatic Static Optimized. After hydration, Next.js will trigger an update to your application to provide the route parameters in the query object. See [Next's documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/automatic-static-optimization) for more information. `isReady` will always return true for server rendered pages.

### Route

If you want to use the generated `Route` type in your code, you can import it from `nextjs-routes`:

```ts
import type { Route } from "nextjs-routes";
```

### Pathname

If you want a type for all possible `pathname`s you can achieve this via `Route`:

```ts
import type { Route } from "nextjs-routes";
type Pathname = Route["pathname"];
```

### RoutedQuery

If you want to use the generated `Query` for a given `Route`, you can import it from `nextjs-routes`:

```ts
import type { RoutedQuery } from "nextjs-routes";
```

### GetServerSidePropsContext

If you're using `getServerSideProps` consider using `GetServerSidePropsContext` from nextjs-routes. This is nearly identical to `GetServerSidePropsContext` from next, but further narrows types based on nextjs-route's route data.

```ts
import type { GetServerSidePropsContext } from "nextjs-routes";

export function getServerSideProps(
  context: GetServerSidePropsContext<"/foos/[foo]">
) {
  // context.params will include `foo` as a string;
  const { foo } = context.params;
}
```

### GetServerSideProps

If you're using `getServerSideProps` and TypeScript 4.9 or later, you can combine the [satisfies](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-9.html#the-satisfies-operator) operator with `GetServerSideProps` from nextjs-routes. This is nearly identical to `GetServerSideProps` from next, but further narrows types based on nextjs-route's route data.

```ts
import type { GetServerSideProps } from "nextjs-routes";

export const getServerSideProps = (async (context) => {
  // context.params will include `foo` as a string;
  const { foo } = context.params;
}) satisfies GetServerSideProps<{}, "/foos/[foo]">;
```

## How does this work? ü§î

`nextjs-routes` generates types for the `pathname` and `query` for every page in your `pages` and/or `app` directory. The generated types are written to `nextjs-routes.d.ts` which is automatically referenced by your Next project's `tsconfig.json`. `nextjs-routes.d.ts` redefines the types for `next/link` and `next/router` and applies the generated route types.

## What if I need a runtime?

There are some cases where you may want to generate a type safe path from a `Route` object, such as when `fetch`ing from an API route or serving redirects from `getServerSideProps`. These accept `strings` instead of the `Route` object that `Link` and `useRouter` accept. Because these do not perform the same string interpolation for dynamic routes, runtime code is required instead of a type only solution.

For these cases, you can use `route` from `nextjs-routes`:

### fetch

```ts
import { route } from "nextjs-routes";

fetch(route({ pathname: "/api/foos/[foo]", query: { foo: "foobar" } }));
```

### getServerSideProps

```ts
import { route, type GetServerSidePropsContext } from "nextjs-routes";

export function getServerSideProps(context: GetServerSidePropsContext) {
  return {
    redirect: {
      destination: route({ pathname: "/foos/[foo]", query: { foo: "foobar" } }),
      permanent: false,
    },
  };
}
```

### Internationalization (i18n)

`nextjs-routes` refines `Link` and `useRouter` based on your [Nextjs i18n configuration](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing).

The following `next.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = withRoutes({
  i18n: {
    defaultLocale: "de-DE",
    locales: ["de-DE", "en-FR", "en-US"],
  },
});
```

Will type `Link` and `useRouter`'s `locale` as `'de-DE' | 'en-FR' | 'en-US'`. All other i18n properties (`defaultLocale`, `domainLocales` and `locales`) are also typed.

If you want to use the generated `Locale` type, you can import it from `nextjs-routes`:

```ts
import { Locale } from "nextjs-routes";
```

## Configuration

You can pass the following options to `withRoutes` in your `next.config.js`:

```js
const withRoutes = require("nextjs-routes/config")({
  outDir: "types",
});
```

- `outDir`: The file path indicating the output directory where the generated route types should be written to (e.g.: "types"). The default is to create the file in the same folder as your `next.config.js` file.

- `cwd`: The path to your `next.config.js` file. This is only necessary for non standard project structures, such as `nx`. If you are an `nx` user getting the `Could not find a Next.js pages directory` error, use `cwd: __dirname`.
